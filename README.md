## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm on a dedicated road to becomeing a full stack developer. I love a good challenge and usually get in over my head but I work good under pressure and the best way to learn is by doing! 

  
## Lessons Learned

While playing with this code to get everything to work I learned you can limit your JavaScript functionality when listening to the DOMContentLoaded. I wasnt able to get as far into the game as I wanted to but it was a fun project and I hope those who find it and play with it enjoy.
